# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I serve as Director of Open Technology for Medic, combining my passion for people management and my dedication to creating digital tools that are free, meaningful, and accessible to all. I collaborate with a vibrant, distributed community that shares a profound commitment: stewarding open-source technology that empowers health workers, bringing vital care to the world's most remote communities. I sincerely believe that when you care, more people will care, too, and I apply that belief to everything I do. 

When I am not working with technology, you will find me studying languages â€“ a pursuit that helps me better understand and connect with people from different cultures.
